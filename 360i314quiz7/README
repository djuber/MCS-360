MCS 360 Quiz 7

Implement a program that validates delimiter nesting in source code.
On mismatched closing delimiter, indicate an error with line number and 
character column number where the mismatch occured.

Use a stack to hold the open delimiters. 

badfile is used to jog the system, and make sure I had enough alloc's
to get useful results from the memory leak checker, and is not part of
the program.

Some additional work would be required to optionally ignore delimiters
included inside quotes, and to allow runtime changes to the set of delimiters.
