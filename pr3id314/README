Infix to Postfix conversion and evaluation

Take an infix expression from the input stream
Clean up expression (single spaces between all binary operators and operands)
Convert to Postfix using C order of operations:
*  / %	left-to-right
+  -	left-to-right
Evaluate and print result

make run to execute
make to build
make test will overwrite program and run test suite
make doc will generate documentation
make clean will remove temporary files

Note: The assigment mentions % as an operator 
(when discussing the precedence of exponentiation) but this is not
defined on floating point numbers. The best we could do is take a- (floor(a/b))*b. This is left associative and equal in precedence to multiplication.

Shunting Yard algorithm is thanks to Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002).
