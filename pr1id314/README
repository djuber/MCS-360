Grocery store inventory program.

make project1 to build
make run to start
make doc to create a manual
make will build program and manual

a script fixdoc will append desirable additions to the Doxyfile
You may need to tailor this to get proper output from doxygen
or simply use your own Doxyfile. You will need to set 
RECURSIVE=YES or it won't find the sources.

a sample inventory is in the inventories folder
the program does understand file opening with relative paths, and backups
will occur in the same path as the original file if trying to overwrite.

Possible long term improvements: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify template of isort to assume vector<T>, and only specify contenttype
or change isort to use iterators rather than index operators. Better yet,
find a better sort algorithm (I think the stl has a good stable_sort).

If vector has been sorted, don't resort by code prior to writing.

Get current month at startup. Current default is invalid month. It would 
be great if this defaulted to the right thing.

Actually track running averages. this requires a number of months
in history field for each item, and would need to be updated during
monthly update when current sales are cleared. Since the Item class
was a little overspecified, I hesitate to add fields.

Clean up addition and scalar multiplication of dollar amounts. Implement
addition operator and multiplication by int or double. This is only used
in calculating sales, and isn't duplicated. Also, move dollar sanity
checks into the constructor (cents < 0 or cents > 99 is wrong).

Rethink names of private fields in Item.
