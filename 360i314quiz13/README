Modify Binary Search Tree code to support removal of nodes.
I used the simplest way possible, with no attempt to preserve balance.
When a node is found with key, set the left tree to the current position,
then graft the right tree into the left tree.
Repeated removals will tend to make the tree highly unbalanced, but so would
in order insertions.
Cleaned up some of the code (typo for destoy/destroy, memory error in find on
an empty tree, no destructor, too many public functions). Added remove(), added
findParent, added insert(node, node) to support grafting.

I understand that a better way to do this would be to maintain balance, but
this requires rewriting both insert and remove to support rebalancing/rotation
using AVL algorithm (CLRS p333 or KW p628-643).

A few worst case removals were added to main, with calls to display following to observe
the effect.
