Singly linked list implementation.
Copy constructor and assignment operator implementations using header node 
and without. Execute `make run` or `make run-header` to test.
Header node implementation and non-header implementation are in 
list.cc and list2.cc, and a single header and client use 
them indistinguishably. 

Tested with Valgrind, no leaks, only additional overhead is one
alloc/free for each List object created at runtime.
